<h1 class="inter-regular"> Are you scared of monsters?</h1>
<h3 class="inter-regular"> She corrected her gaze, A seven foot tall human stood yards away from her. The creature didn't pull a single smile muscle. The biggest eyes she had ever seen; though she still couldn't confirm that they were even eyes. The eyes were the deepest shade of black Isabell eyes had ever made contact with. The creature's hair was bleached blonde, though it seemed as if it was just a giant blonde block on the creature's head. Its clothes were a dark shade of green, the same colour of its pants. Its shoes seemed to be made out of the same material as its clothes, though it seemed a lot heavier and thicker, as the shoes (at least from Isabells distance) seemed as big as her head. She gasped the loudest she ever had in her entire life. Though, what seemed to make the horrific sight even worse, was the swarm of kids (around four or five years old) smiling and running around the creature, as it stared deep into Isabells soul. They were singing a creepy yet happy song that dug deep into Isabells ears.

    "Everyone Loves Norm, he's the nicest person I've ever met, everyone loves Norm, he has a smile youll never forget!"

    Which surprised Isabell, as she could clearly see Norm, had no smile on his face, just a pure blank stare that pierced into Isabellâ€™s delicate soul.</3>
